# Demo travel app for hackslash inductions
# Read in code view
#I will explain how I made this project in this file called README.md
#First of all we make a new flutter project in android studio
#We get a sample code written in main.dart in lib folder
#Using its help we can write the code for our travel app.
#import works like pre-processor hash in c
#Then we have void main() which basically tells to run the app
#Now we write the code for our TravelApp
#Using widgets like Scaffold, Column, AppBar, SizedBox we can create the layout for our android application
#We can also make widgets of our own as per our needs like we made _buildDestinationCard and _buildPlaceItem in our travelapp
#for inserting pictures in the mobile application, we have to make a new directory with the name assets, then have an images folder where we will keep the images required for the app
#we will then write the paths of our images in pubspec,yaml file under the assets after uncommenting it from the default file
#using various codeblocks in our file we can eventually make a visually appealing mobile application

#I did face challenges while making this project as i used for the first time. The study jams did help a lot.
#setting up flutter and android studio and seeing how things work was a hassle in itself 
#i feel like i can make better containers in the applications to make it more visually appealing with time and more practice
#i still have to master dart to make better mobile applications
#looking forward to improve gradually :)
